## 🧭 Codex Pre-Flight (Required)

### Persona (pick one)
- [ ] persona:core
- [ ] persona:infra
- [x] persona:docs

### Scope Lock 🔒
- **Goal (one sentence):** Add canonical version pinning and integration guidance for downstream repositories consuming flowbiz-ai-core contracts.
- **In-scope files:** `docs/contracts/**`, `README.md`, `docs/PR_LOG.md`, `docs/PR_STATE.md`, `docs/pr_notes/PR-024.2.md`
- **Out-of-scope (3 bullets):**
  1. No runtime/business logic changes in `apps/**` or `packages/**`
  2. No infrastructure/deploy changes (`.github/**`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `nginx/**`, VPS)
  3. No platform/client implementation code (only guidance/contracts boundaries)
- **Behavior changes:**
  - [x] none
  - [ ] yes (describe):

### Evidence (required)
- **PR description read:** [x]
- **CI failures read (if any):** [x]
- **Relevant logs / stack trace captured:** `Baseline on main before branch: ruff check . => PASS, pytest -q => 192 passed`

### Plan (max 5 steps)
1. Add version pinning and compatibility policy doc for downstream consumers
2. Add integration notes for contract imports and upgrade workflow
3. Link new docs from README/contracts docs for discoverability
4. Run `ruff check .` and `pytest -q`
5. Update `docs/PR_LOG.md` and `docs/PR_STATE.md`, then merge ff-only

### Commands I will run locally
- [x] `ruff check .`
- [x] `pytest -q`
- [ ] Any smoke command (if relevant): N/A

### Safety
- **New deps added?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — list + reason:
- **Secrets/env touched?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — explain:

### Exit Criteria
- [x] CI green on PR
- [x] Summary + Testing filled in PR body
- [x] No scope creep
