## 🧭 Codex Pre-Flight (Required)

### Persona (pick one)
- [ ] persona:core
- [x] persona:infra
- [ ] persona:docs

### Scope Lock 🔒
- **Goal (one sentence):** Document multi-tenant deployment requirements and safety boundaries only, without performing deploy/infra changes in core.
- **In-scope files:** `docs/MULTI_TENANT_DEPLOY_SPEC.md`, `docs/PR_LOG.md`, `docs/PR_STATE.md`, `docs/pr_notes/PR-119.md`
- **Out-of-scope (3 bullets):**
  1. No deploy execution, VPS changes, nginx edits, compose changes, or `.github` changes
  2. No multi-tenant runtime implementation in core
  3. No secrets/credentials handling
- **Behavior changes:**
  - [ ] none
  - [x] yes (describe): Adds docs-only multi-tenant deploy specification with explicit platform ownership

### Evidence (required)
- **PR description read:** [x]
- **CI failures read (if any):** [x] — N/A
- **Relevant logs / stack trace captured:** `N/A`

### Plan (max 5 steps)
1. Add `docs/MULTI_TENANT_DEPLOY_SPEC.md` with safety/ownership boundaries
2. Update PR tracking docs
3. Run `ruff check .` and `pytest -q`
4. Commit `PR-119`
5. Merge ff-only to `main`

### Commands I will run locally
- [x] `ruff check .`
- [x] `pytest -q` (or `pytest tests/<specific> -q`)
- [ ] Any smoke command (if relevant): `N/A`

### Safety
- **New deps added?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — list + reason:
- **Secrets/env touched?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — explain:

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] CI green on PR
- [ ] Summary + Testing filled in PR body
- [x] No scope creep
