## 🧭 Codex Pre-Flight (Required)

### Persona (pick one)
- [x] persona:core
- [ ] persona:infra
- [ ] persona:docs

### Scope Lock 🔒
- **Goal (one sentence):** Add CRM integration contracts/stubs and docs only in core without provider-specific adapter implementation.
- **In-scope files:** `packages/core/contracts/integrations.py`, `tests/test_integrations_contracts.py`, `docs/CRM_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`, `docs/contracts/stubs/integrations/crm_sync_request.json`, `docs/PR_LOG.md`, `docs/PR_STATE.md`, `docs/pr_notes/PR-115.md`
- **Out-of-scope (3 bullets):**
  1. No CRM API/provider adapters
  2. No credentials/secrets/sync job runtime implementation
  3. No infra/deploy changes
- **Behavior changes:**
  - [ ] none
  - [x] yes (describe): Adds CRM integration boundary contracts and docs/stubs only

### Evidence (required)
- **PR description read:** [x]
- **CI failures read (if any):** [x] — N/A
- **Relevant logs / stack trace captured:** `N/A`

### Plan (max 5 steps)
1. Extend `integrations.py` with CRM contracts/stub
2. Extend tests
3. Add docs/spec and JSON stub
4. Run `ruff check .` and `pytest -q`
5. Update PR tracking docs and commit/merge

### Commands I will run locally
- [x] `ruff check .`
- [x] `pytest -q` (or `pytest tests/<specific> -q`)
- [ ] Any smoke command (if relevant): `N/A`

### Safety
- **New deps added?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — list + reason:
- **Secrets/env touched?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — explain:

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] CI green on PR
- [ ] Summary + Testing filled in PR body
- [x] No scope creep
