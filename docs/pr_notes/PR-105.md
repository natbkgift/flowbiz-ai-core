## 🧭 Codex Pre-Flight (Required)

### Persona (pick one)
- [x] persona:core
- [ ] persona:infra
- [ ] persona:docs

### Scope Lock 🔒
- **Goal (one sentence):** Add example workflow specs and validation tests/docs using existing workflow contracts only.
- **In-scope files:** `docs/EXAMPLE_WORKFLOWS.md`, `docs/contracts/stubs/workflows/*`, `tests/test_workflow_examples.py`, `docs/PR_LOG.md`, `docs/PR_STATE.md`, `docs/pr_notes/PR-105.md`
- **Out-of-scope (3 bullets):**
  1. No workflow engine/orchestrator implementation changes
  2. No UI/visual editor implementation
  3. No infra/deploy/platform integration changes
- **Behavior changes:**
  - [ ] none
  - [x] yes (describe): Adds validated example workflow JSON stubs and tests for developer reference

### Evidence (required)
- **PR description read:** [x]
- **CI failures read (if any):** [x] — N/A
- **Relevant logs / stack trace captured:** `N/A`

### Plan (max 5 steps)
1. Add example workflow JSON stubs under docs/contracts/stubs/workflows
2. Add tests validating stubs against workflow contracts
3. Add docs linking examples and explaining scope boundaries
4. Run `ruff check .` and `pytest -q`
5. Update `PR_LOG` + `PR_STATE`, commit/merge `PR-105`

### Commands I will run locally
- [x] `ruff check .`
- [x] `pytest -q` (or `pytest tests/<specific> -q`)
- [ ] Any smoke command (if relevant): `N/A`

### Safety
- **New deps added?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — list + reason:
- **Secrets/env touched?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — explain:

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] CI green on PR
- [ ] Summary + Testing filled in PR body
- [x] No scope creep
