## 🧭 Codex Pre-Flight (Required)

### Persona (pick one)
- [x] persona:core
- [ ] persona:infra
- [ ] persona:docs

### Scope Lock 🔒
- **Goal (one sentence):** Establish and document the schema-only contract package boundary for cross-repo data contracts.
- **In-scope files:** `packages/core/contracts/**`, `tests/test_contract_package.py`, `docs/contracts/**`, `docs/PR_LOG.md`, `docs/PR_STATE.md`, `docs/pr_notes/PR-024.1.md`
- **Out-of-scope (3 bullets):**
  1. No changes to infrastructure/deployment files (`.github/**`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `nginx/**`)
  2. No platform/client adapters, no billing/UI logic
  3. No deploy/VPS/secrets actions
- **Behavior changes:**
  - [ ] none
  - [x] yes (describe): Adds explicit contract-package docs/tests and package export assertions; no runtime integration behavior change.

### Evidence (required)
- **PR description read:** [x]
- **CI failures read (if any):** [x]
- **Relevant logs / stack trace captured:** `Baseline: ruff check . => PASS, pytest launcher path issue resolved with python -m pytest => 188 passed`

### Plan (max 5 steps)
1. Add contract package documentation clarifying schema-only boundaries
2. Add tests validating package exports and model contract invariants
3. Run `ruff check .` and `pytest -q`
4. Update `docs/PR_LOG.md` and `docs/PR_STATE.md`
5. Commit and merge ff-only into `main`

### Commands I will run locally
- [x] `ruff check .`
- [x] `pytest -q` (via `python -m pytest -q`)
- [ ] Any smoke command (if relevant): N/A

### Safety
- **New deps added?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — list + reason:
- **Secrets/env touched?**
  - [x] no
  - [ ] yes — explain:

### Exit Criteria
- [x] CI green on PR
- [x] Summary + Testing filled in PR body
- [x] No scope creep
